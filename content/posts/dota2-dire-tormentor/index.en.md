Get ready for the journey of making fully custom hybrid figure & gaming pc build, based on this unique DOTA 2's creep boss. Made by DOTA fan for another DOTA fan.

"Tormentors are powerful neutral creep bosses that difficult to take down due to their quickly regenerating barriers and their very potent damage reflection. Defeating a Tormentor result handsome kill rewards, making it quite worthwhile to take them on." - DOTA 2 WIKI
